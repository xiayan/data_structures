main.cpp: inserting numbers into 2-3 tree, and perform insert, deleteMin, deleteMax and remove to test the implementation.

test.cpp: Test module for MinMaxHeap.  The test performs 200,000 random operations and check whether the MinMaxHeap is still valid after each operation.
Run "make test" to build the test code, and "./test.out" to do the random tests.
